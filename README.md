# Orb's Bad Maps (and Backgrounds)
Orb's Bad Maps is a collection of quick battlemaps and backgrounds I have made for my own games in Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

I am not a fantasy cartographer.
I have no talent. I do not have a Patreon. 
There are no works of art here and no animation.
I make maps because I run online games and need maps, preferably reusable ones.

My only goal is to save you a bit of time or maybe provide a map that is good enough for your needs in a pinch.

All content (underlying images, the FVTT scenes) in this module is not only free, it is released under the UNLICENSE, so you can do what you want with it, no attribution required.

I am always developing a map or two. Check back often for updates.

## About the Maps
* Almost all maps are 2000 x 2000 pixels, with a grid size of 50 pixels. This creates a 40 x 40 square-grid battlemap
* The images underlying the maps are gridless. Feel free to use them in your own Scenes
* I have added walls if the map required it, but that is about it
* Few if any maps make use of placed lights
* All maps have been configured with the following settings:
  * Display full size when initially opened
  * Display a grid of 5ft sqaures
  * FVTT Token Vision is ENABLED
  * Map lighting levels have NOT been adjusted
  * Fog of War is ENABLED
  * No Sound or Enviormental Effects are added
  * The Scene will initially NOT be displayed in the Scene Selection buttons visible to users
  * Off-grid padding has been set to 0% (no padding)

## About the Backgrounds
Backgrounds are just textured images with no additional imagery.
Their purpose is to provide a background other than the default FVTT gray found as the Scene default.
Some players and DMs do not like the complexity of dynamic lighting or cluttered battlemaps. Using a textured background instead of the steel-gray default Scene background can add flavor to the VTT without the full complexity of battlemaps.

* All backgrounds are 2000 x 2000 pixels, with a grid size of 50 pixels. This creates a 40 x 40 square-grid background
* The images underlying the backgrounds are gridless. Feel free to use them in your own Scenes
* All backgrounds have been configured with the following settings:
  * Display full size when initially opened
  * Display a grid of 5ft sqaures
  * FVTT Token Vision is DISABLED
  * Global Illumination is ENABLED
  * Fog of War is DISABLED
  * No Sound or Enviormental Effects are added
  * The Scene will initially NOT be displayed in the Scene Selection buttons visible to users
  * Off-grid padding has been set to 0% (no padding)

# Attribution
* All images were created by me (badly) and were not derived from other work
* AI was not used to create these images 
* All images were created using Inkarnate Pro (see http://inkarnate.com for more information). Inkarnate releases all of its images, tokens, textures and other assets to its users for commercial or non-commercial purposes, so I am free to republish their assets in my work and UNLICENSE them to you

# Changelog
The latest production version is listed at the top of the table.
Older versions are listed below the top row.
In general, you should use the tagged version of this software compatible with the version of FVTT you are running.

## FVTT Compatibility Note
If you do not see your version listed, that is ok. You can _probably_ just use this module anyway.
If you find you cannot make direct use of the scenes because of a Foundry version compatibility issue, feel free to use the images assets to build your own battlemaps and backgrounds.
You can find the raw image files in the directory where this module is stored on your local system.

## Major and Minor Versions of this Software
Major version changes in this software do _not_ mean that this software itself is undergoing a breaking change.
This software will update it's major version when FVTT makes a major revision (going from FVTT v9 -> v10 for example).

This software will make minor version changes to add new features to a major version.

This software will make patch version changes to address defects or perform chores within a minor version.

## Changelog Updates
This Changelog wil be updated with each version change.
This Changelog will be periodically updated to reflect the latest version of FVTT on which the Compendiums have been tested.
